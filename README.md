# Helm Chart for CogStack's MedCAT Trainer

This is an early work in progress and is based on the `docker-compose.yaml` file
at <https://github.com/CogStack/MedCATtrainer>.

Please see the commit history for current status of development.

This README file will be updated as soon as a working configuration has been
achieved.

Currently, this is being tested in Azure Kubernetes Service only.

Contributions are welcome.
